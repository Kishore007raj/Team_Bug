- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory of your project:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### Running the Backend

### Folder Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the React application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
